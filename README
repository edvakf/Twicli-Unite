=== Introduction ===
twicli <http://www.geocities.jp/twicli/twicli.html> is a browser based twitter
client that was originally developed by NeoCat <http://twitter.com/NeoCat>.

I, edvakf <http://my.opera.com/edvakf/blog/>, ported it to Opera Unite.
The main part of twicli is almost not modified at all.
What I did was to make a twicli plugin, operaunite.js, and the server side
caching mechanizm.

This is not a fork of the original Twicli, so when the original is updated,
all you need to do to be up-to-date is to download the files from the 
repository <http://coderepos.org/share/browser/websites/twicli/> and put
them into the "public_html" directory.
